## [Bite 35. Having fun with heapq](https://codechalleng.es/bites/35/)

In this Bite you are provided with 3 data structures: a list of `int`s, a list of `datetime`s, and a list of `dict`s.

Complete the 3 functions to return the _largest n_ of each using `heapq` (our tests require this data `type` here).

Have fun and keep calm and code in Python!
