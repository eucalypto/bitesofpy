## [Bite 33. Transpose a data structure](https://codechalleng.es/bites/33/)

Sometimes you need to restructure a nested data structure. For example you can convert a `dict` in a `list` of (`key`, `value`) tuples via `dict.items()`.

In this Bite a real world scenario where we wanted to plot some data from a `Counter dict`.

For plots you typically need 2 lists: X + Y axis or labels + values. So we needed an easy way to transpose data structures.

Complete the `transpose` function to do just that. It has to work for both dicts and lists of (named)tuples. Examples given in the _docstring_. See also the TESTS tab. Have fun!
