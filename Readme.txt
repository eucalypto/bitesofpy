This project is in python. I'm using a virtual environment on each
machine that I use to work on this.

The virtual environment is not in git. But some bites need special
packages via pip.

See "requirements.txt" file for all python packages that are required.


Usage (in preferred virtual environment)

Install:
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Generate requirements.txt:
  `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
